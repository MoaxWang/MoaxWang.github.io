**Still Editing**

Point of zero charge (pzc) is an important concept in colloid chemistry. I am trying to learn it and utilize this knowledge in my study. This paper only talks about my personal understanding of pzc. Knowledge of zeta potential is not critical to understand pzc, but it would greatly help me to know what truly happened inside the colloid when we talking about pzc.

Before we talk about the electrochemical things, let us define the system in analysis. Assuming we have a colloidal system contains two composition, and the substance A is evenly dispersed in the substance B in a tiny scale. We probably will have eight different status depends on the type of the substances.

|||*Substance A* $\Downarrow$||
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|***Substance B*** $\Downarrow$|**Gas**|**Liquid**|**Solid**|
|**Gas**|None|Liquid Aerosols|Solid Aerosols|
|**Liquid**|Liquid Foam|Emulsion|Sol|
|**Solid**|Solid Foam|Gel|Solid Sol|

Sol and emulsion would be the major system we focusing on in this topic, as they do have an efficient transportation of ions in the system and easy for me to understand it.

# 1. Zeta Potential

Zeta potential (Î¶-potential) is the potential at the slipping plane. The unit of this potential usually is millivolts (mv). It basically reflects the energy consumed to move an monovalent charged ion from an infinity distance to the slipping plane on an opposite charged particle.

## 1.1 Electrodouble Layer

The concept of zeta potential is tightly correlated with the theory of electrodouble layer (EDL). Now, we have a aqueous solution at the interface with a negative charged solid surface. We can simply cut the solution into 3 sectors based on the concentration of positive charged ions. It is easy to understand that only positive charged ions would lay on the surface, and form a single ion layer, since the negative charged ions are repelled from the surface and the positive ions are so love to stay on the negative charged surface. This thin layer is the first section, and the surface of this layer named **stern layer**. The repulsion force will, of course, decrease with the distance increasing, so it is reasonable that some of negative ions will mixed into a bunch of positive ions outside of the stern layer (Because the positive ions around the surface are so attractive to negative ions in solution. Who will refuse a lovely party that you are the only one boy/girl). Another layer, which contains part of mobile fluid from the solution which attached to the stern layer, hence, be called **slipping plane**. The combine of stern layer and slipping plane is called **diffuse layer**. Everything outside the diffuse layer are belongs to **bulk liquid**. The electrical potential at the stern layer and slipping plane are **stern potential** and **zeta potential** respectively.
